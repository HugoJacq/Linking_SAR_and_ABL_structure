  abstract = {Abstract                            The imprint of marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) dynamical structures on sea surface roughness, as seen from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions, is investigated. We focus on 13 February 2020, a case study of the elucidating the role of clouds-circulation coupling in climate field campaign. For suppressed conditions, convective rolls imprint on sea surface roughness is confirmed through the intercomparison with MABL turbulent organization deduced from airborne measurements. A discretization of the SAR wide swath into 25~{\texttimes}~25~km               2               tiles then allows us to capture the spatial variability of the turbulence organization varying from rolls to cells. Second, we objectively detect cold pools within the SAR image and combine them with geostationary brightness temperature. The geometrical or physically-based metrics of cold pools are correlated to cloud properties. This provides a promising methodology to analyze the dynamics of convective systems as seen from below and above.                        ,              Plain Language Summary             We propose an innovative approach to investigate the marine atmospheric boundary layer dynamics by combining spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, brightness temperature from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and in situ turbulence airborne measurements. Focusing on 13 February 2020, two types of atmospheric processes are investigated: trade wind boundary layer organizations and cold pools. The signature of coherent structures on sea surface roughness, especially convective rolls, is validated with respect to the turbulence airborne measurements. The cold pools are detected within the SAR image using an identification technique based on the filtering of backscatter signal increments. Cold pool characteristics such as their size or the gust front intensity can then be directly derived from the SAR image. The GOES images provide cloud field properties every 10~min. Exploring backward cloud evolution with respect to the SAR image timing appears able to catch the life cycle of cold pools and convective clouds from which they originate. The application of this approach could pave the way to access the dynamics of convective systems as seen from below and above, allowing to go one step further in the quantitative use of SAR images to investigate boundary layer processes.           ,              Key Points                                                                Atmospheric coherent structures, rolls and cold pools are systematically detected and analyzed in a high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wide swath image                                                     Properties of rolls from SAR measurements are comparable with the circulation organization deduced from airborne data                                                     A diversity of cold pool geometrical and dynamical features is related to cloud life cycle provided by satellite brightness temperature},

  abstract = {Abstract. Sea ice surface patterns encode more information than can be represented solely by the ice fraction. The aim of this paper is thus to establish the importance of using a broader set of surface characterization metrics and to identify a minimal set of such metrics that may be useful for representing sea ice in Earth system models. Large-eddy simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer over various idealized sea ice patterns, with equivalent ice fractions and average floe areas, demonstrate that the spatial organization of ice and water can play a crucial role in determining boundary layer structures. Thus, various methods used to quantify heterogeneity in categorical lattice-based spatial data, such as those used in landscape ecology and Geographic Information System (GIS) studies, are employed here on a set of recently declassified high-resolution sea ice surface images. It is found that, in conjunction with ice fraction, patch density (representing the fragmentation of the surface), the splitting index (representing variability in patch size), and the perimeter--area fractal dimension (representing the tortuosity of the interface) are all required to describe the two-dimensional pattern exhibited by a sea ice surface. For surfaces with anisotropic patterns, the orientation of the surface relative to the mean wind is also needed. Finally, scaling laws are derived for these relevant landscape metrics, allowing for their estimation using aggregated spatial sea ice surface data at any resolution. The methods used in and the results gained from this study represent a first step toward developing further methods for quantifying variability in polar sea ice surfaces and for parameterizing mixed ice--water surfaces in coarse geophysical models.},

S-1's wave mode (WV) captures 20x20 km image patches at 5 m pixel resolution and is unaffected by cloud cover or time-of-day. The mission's open data policy has made SAR data easily accessible for a range of applications, but the need for manual image annotations is a bottleneck that hinders the use of machine learning methods. This study uses nearly 10 million WV-mode images and contrastive self-supervised learning to train a semantic embedding model called WV-Net. In multiple downstream tasks, WV-Net outperforms a comparable model that was pre-trained on natural images (ImageNet) with supervised learning. Experiments show improvements for estimating wave height (0.50 vs 0.60 RMSE using linear probing), estimating near-surface air temperature (0.90 vs 0.97 RMSE), and performing multilabel-classification of geophysical and atmospheric phenomena (0.96 vs 0.95 micro-averaged AUROC). WV-Net embeddings are also superior in an unsupervised image-retrieval task and scale better in data-sparse settings. Together, these results demonstrate that WV-Net embeddings can support geophysical research by providing a convenient foundation model for a variety of data analysis and exploration tasks.},

It is a limited-area model employing advanced numerical techniques, including monotonic advection schemes for scalar transport and fourth-order centered or odd-order WENO advection schemes for momentum. The model includes state-of-the-art physics parameterization schemes that are important to represent convective-scale phenomena and turbulent eddies, as well as flows at larger scales. In addition, Meso-NH has been expanded to provide capabilities for a range of Earth system prediction applications such as chemistry and aerosols, electricity and lightning, hydrology, wildland fires, volcanic eruptions, and cyclones with ocean coupling. Here, we present the main innovations to the dynamics and physics of the code since the pioneer paper of Lafore et~al. (1998) and provide an overview of recent applications and couplings.},

A linear stability analysis using von Neumann theory is first conducted that considers six different ERK time integration methods. A new graphical representation of linear stability is proposed, which allows a first discrimination between the ERK methods. The theoretical analysis is then completed by tests on numerical problems of increasing complexity (linear advection of high wind gradient, orographic waves, density current, large eddy simulation of fog, and windstorm simulation), using a fourth-order-centered scheme as a reference basis. The five-stage third-order and fourth-order ERK combinations appear as the time integration methods of choice for coupling with WENO schemes in terms of stability. An explicit time-splitting method added to the ERK temporal scheme for WENO improves the stability properties slightly more. When the spatial discretizations are compared, WENO schemes present the main advantage of maintaining stable, nonoscillatory transitions with sharp discontinuities, but WENO third order is excessively damping, while WENO fifth order provides better accuracy. Finally, WENO fifth order combined with the ERK method makes the whole physics of the model 3 times faster compared to the classical fourth-order centered scheme associated with the leapfrog temporal scheme.}

Quantification performance is assessed on Obukhov length               L               , an atmospheric surface-layer stability metric. The first method correlates spectral energy at specific turbulence-spectrum wavelengths directly to               L               . Improved results are obtained from the second method, which relies on a machine-learning algorithm trained on a wider array of SAR-derived parameters. When applied on scenes containing convective signatures, the second method is able to predict approximately 80\% of observed variance with respect to validation. Estimated wind speed provides the bulk of predictive power while parameters related to the kilometer-scale distribution of spectral energy contribute to a significant reduction in prediction errors, enabling the methodology to be applied on a scene-by-scene basis.

These observations don't measure the atmospheric state directly. Rather, they capture the kilometer-scale variability of the ocean-surface roughness which is correlated to specific ocean-atmosphere stability conditions. By combining parameters and statistics extracted from the radar measurements with machine learning, estimation performance largely exceeds that of a previously suggested approach. With these results, the disequilibrium between the air and sea surface temperature, central to determining sensible heat fluxes over the oceans, shall be more quantitatively and systematically assessed. These results have the potential of guiding improvements in climate models as differences between our physically based estimates and parameterized climate models may indicate and diagnose shortcomings in the latter.           ,              Key Points                                                                Global-scale estimation of atmospheric instability from synthetic aperture radar high-resolution ocean-roughness observations                                                     First-order roughness statistics enable estimation on a climatological scale                                                     O(1~km) roughness characteristics enable estimation on a scene-by-scene basis},

Stratification is quantified using a bulk Richardson number,               Ri               , derived from collocated ERA5 surface analyses. The three stratification states are defined as unstable:               Ri               ~{$<~-$}0.012, near-neutral: -0.012~{$<~$}               Ri               {$<$} +0.001, and stable:               Ri               {$>$} +0.001. These boundaries are identified by the characteristic boundary layer coherent structures that form in these regimes and modulate the surface roughness imaged by the radar. An automated machine learning algorithm identifies the coherent structures impressed on the images. Data from 2016 to 2019 are used to examine spatial and temporal variation in these state estimates in terms of expected wind and thermal forcing. This new satellite-based approach for detecting air-sea stratification has implications for weather modeling and air-sea flux products.                        ,              Plain Language Summary             The air-sea fluxes of momentum, heat, and water vapor are crucial climate data records because they represent lower boundary conditions on the atmospheric circulation and upper boundary conditions of ocean waves and currents. Global measurements of these fluxes using conventional fixed-station systems are impractical making satellite observations attractive. It is very difficult to measure two crucial parameters: the temperature and humidity of the air near the sea surface. The study's motivation is that external information about the air-sea stratification should improve the retrieval of these parameters. We demonstrate a global capability to classify air-sea stratification based on variations in the sea surface texture of high-resolution radar images. This is possible because the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer develops distinct circulations in different stratification regimes. Perturbation surface winds induced by these coherent structures induce a modulation of the ocean surface roughness that is resolved by orbiting radars. An automatic machine learning algorithm detects the characteristic structures, which we correlated to a standard global data assimilation surface analysis. An important research outcome is the largest all-weather data set of boundary layer coherent structures and the conditions under which they exist. Examination of these data will advance our understanding of fundamental boundary layer processes.           ,              Key Points                                                                Common atmospheric boundary layer coherent structures are classified using high-resolution global satellite sea surface radar roughness data                                                     Coherent structures partition into separate unstable, near-neutral, and stable stratification regimes                                                     Three-regime coherent structure and stratification classification can aid air-sea flux estimation and atmosphere boundary layer parameterization},
