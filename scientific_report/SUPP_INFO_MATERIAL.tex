%  SUPPORTING INFORMATION TEMPLATE
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%
%Please use this template when formatting and submitting your Supporting Information.

%This template serves as both a “table of contents” for the supporting information for your article and as a summary of files.
%
%
%OVERVIEW
%
%Please note that all supporting information will be peer reviewed with your manuscript. It will not be copyedited if the paper is accepted.
%In general, the purpose of the supporting information is to enable authors to provide and archive auxiliary information such as data tables, method information, figures, video, or computer software, in digital formats so that other scientists can use it.
%The key criteria are that the data:
% 1. supplement the main scientific conclusions of the paper but are not essential to the conclusions (with the exception of
%    including %data so the experiment can be reproducible);
% 2. are likely to be usable or used by other scientists working in the field;
% 3. are described with sufficient precision that other scientists can understand them, and
% 4. are not exe files.
%
%USING THIS TEMPLATE
%
%***All references should be included in the reference list of the main paper so that they can be indexed, linked, and counted as citations.  The reference section does not count toward length limits.
%
%All Supporting text and figures should be included in this document. Insert supporting information content into each appropriate section of the template. To add additional captions, simply copy and paste each sample as needed.

%Tables may be included, but can also be uploaded separately, especially if they are larger than 1 page, or if necessary for retaining table formatting. Data sets, large tables, movie files, and audio files should be uploaded separately. Include their captions in this document and list the file name with the caption. You will be prompted to upload these files on the Upload Files tab during the submission process, using file type “Supporting Information (SI)”

\noindent\textbf{Introduction}

This file contains details about the conditional sampling: first a description about the flux computations is given, then a sensitivity study of the radio active decay parameter $\nu$ is exposed. 

\noindent\textbf{Flux computations}

    In this paper, the following notations are used for the turbulent fluxes: $a$ is fluctuations of $A$ from the mean value $<$A$>$,  so that $A$ = $<$A$>$ + $a$. Then correlations of two fluctuating variables $a$ and $b$ can be formed: $<ab>$ = $<\tilde{a} \tilde{b}>$ + $<F_{SGS,ab}>$ with $<>$ the average operator. $\tilde{a}$ are resolved fluctuations, $<ab>$ is the mean flux, $<\tilde{a} \tilde{b}>$ is the mean resolved and $<F_{SGS,ab}>$ is the mean subgrid flux.
    
    % indiquer ici comment le split est calculé 
    Once the coherent objects have been identified by the conditional sampling, we split any flow quantity into the sum of contributions from detected object $i$ plus a residual. A covariance between resolved quantities $\tilde{a}$ and $\tilde{b}$ can be decomposed as follow:  
    
        \begin{equation}
            < \tilde{a}\tilde{b} > = \sum_i \alpha_i < \tilde{a}\tilde{b} >_i + \, residual
            \label{flx_contrib}
        \end{equation}
    with $<$.$>_i$ the conditional average on the object $i$ and $\alpha_i$ the horizontal area of object $i$.
    % indiquer ici comment la valeur intégrée est calculée
    On top of the previous decomposition, vertically integrated contributions from each structure can be computed:
    
        \begin{equation}
            F_{ab,i} = \frac{\int_0^{1.1zi}  \alpha_i < \tilde{a}\tilde{b} >_i}{ \int_0^{1.1zi} < \tilde{a}\tilde{b} > }
            \label{integ_contrib}
        \end{equation}
    The $i$th object contribution is integrated from the surface to 1.1$z_i$ to account for the overshooting thermals \cite{brient_coherent_2024}.
    
    Given labeled objects, one can also decompose their flux contribution to the mean flux into a top-hat part and an intra-variability part \cite{wang_top-hat_2000}:
        \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
             <uw> = \sum_{i=1}^{3} \alpha_i (U_i-<U>)(W_i-<W>) + \\ \sum_{i=1}^{3} \alpha_i<(U-U_i)(W-W_i)>_i
        \end{split}
        \label{tophateq}
        \end{equation}
    with $U_i=<U>_i$. The three categories used here are ``updraft",``downdraft" and ``other". In Equation \ref{tophateq}, the first RHS term is the sum of the top-hat contributions and the second term is the sum of intra-variability contributions.

\noindent\textbf{\(\nu\) sensitivity analysis}
    
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Sensitivity_tau_C10_m1_g0.5_SVT.png}
        \caption{ Sensitivity of the vertically integrated turbulent fluxes contribution from each object to the tracer radioactive time decay $\nu$. $\nu$ is the same for all the objects. The objects are detected by the C10  conditional sampling with $m$ = 1, g = 0.05 \%. The contributions plotted here are anomalies from the contribution with $\nu$ $\approx$ $t^*$ = 14 min, that is the default value of $\nu$ recommended by \protect\citeA{couvreux_resolved_2010}.}
        
        % \citeA{couvreux_resolved_2010}
        % \citeA{couvreux_resolved_2010}
        \label{Sensitivity_tau}
    \end{figure}
    
    The tracers emitted during the simulations follow \citeA{couvreux_resolved_2010} and go under a radioactive decay of time scale $\nu$. The value of $\nu$ is set to be approximately equals to the convective time scale $t^*$=$z_i$/$w^*$ but this could be inappropriate for the heterogeneous case studied here, and even more for structures that do not evolve on a timescale of $t^*$, e.g. object originating from the top of the ABL. A sensitivity study on $\nu$ has been conducted to help address this problem. Figure \ref{Sensitivity_tau} shows the sensitivity anomaly (with respect to the default $\nu$ = 15 min) of each object contribution to the momentum and heat turbulent flux (the conditional sampling is done only on the resolved part of the flow). Tested values are $\nu \in $ [1,4,7,10,12,15,20,30,40]min. The contribution of the $i$th object to the flux $<\tilde{a}\tilde{b}>$ is computed with Equation \ref{integ_contrib}. The simulation configuration used for these tests is the reference simulation with a cold SST (RefC), only changing the radioactive decay time scale for all tracers. 
    
    Profiles of flux decomposition with $\nu$ = 15 min for the two reference simulations can be seen on Figure 11 on the main paper. Looking at Figure \ref{Sensitivity_tau}, the conditional sampling partitions the turbulent fluxes fairly consistently for values of $\nu$ = 4min to $\nu$ = 40 min. Below 4 min, there is simply not enough tracer in the flow to describe coherent structures. Overall, the part of the flow described by the coherent structure is increasing with increasing $\nu$ but only up to a critical value $\nu_c$, different for the structures in the $<\tilde{u}\tilde{w}>$ decomposition ($\nu_c$ = 15 min for "updraft" and $\nu_c$ = 20 min for "downdraft") while the structures have similar $\nu_c$ for the decomposition of $<\tilde{w}\tilde{\theta_v}>$ ($\nu_c$ = 20 min). Initial simulations were run with $\nu$ = 15 min and according to the weak sensitivity to $\nu$ we decided to keep the original runs.

% Break each line at a sign of operation

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER

% You may change equation numbering by resetting

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
